# Security

## Cryptography

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Key Derivation | Argon2id (256MB memory, 4 iterations) |
| Encryption | XChaCha20-Poly1305 |
| Checksums | BLAKE2b |
| RAM Protection | Keys encrypted with Ascon-128a, zeroized on drop |
| Memory Locking | mlock(2) prevents secrets from swapping to disk |
| Code Safety | Pure Rust, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` |
| Threshold Sigs | FROST with BIP-340 Schnorr |
| Hardware Isolation | AWS Nitro Enclaves with attestation-based KMS |

## Memory Locking

Keep uses `mlock(2)` to prevent secret key material from being paged to disk. If mlock fails (common on systems with low `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK`), Keep warns but continues with degraded security.

**If you see the warning:**
```text
Warning: Failed to lock memory. Secrets may be paged to disk.
To fix: ulimit -l unlimited (or increase RLIMIT_MEMLOCK)
```

**Solutions:**
- Temporary: `ulimit -l unlimited` before running keep
- Permanent: Add to `/etc/security/limits.conf`:
  ```conf
  * soft memlock unlimited
  * hard memlock unlimited
  ```
- Containers: Use `--no-mlock` flag to disable (accepts degraded security)

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/privkeyio/keep/security/advisories/new) rather than opening a public issue.
